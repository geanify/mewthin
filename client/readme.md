# Multiplayer Red Square Movement POC

This is a simple proof-of-concept for a multiplayer game where each player controls a red square. Player positions are synchronized via a server using websockets. The server is authoritative and tracks all player movements.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.
4. If you want to build the project, run `npm run build`.

---

This project is a clean starting point for building more complex multiplayer games.
